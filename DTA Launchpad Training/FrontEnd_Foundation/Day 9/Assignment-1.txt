Q: What is JSON ?
Ans:
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data
JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page

JSON Syntax Rules:
Data is in name/value pairs
Data is separated by commas
Curly braces hold objects
Square brackets hold arrays

JSON Objects:
JSON objects are written inside curly braces.
Just like in JavaScript, objects can contain multiple name/value pairs:
{"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"}

JSON Arrays:
JSON arrays are written inside square brackets.
Just like in JavaScript, an array can contain objects:
"employees":[
    {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"},
    {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},
    {"firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones"}
]
